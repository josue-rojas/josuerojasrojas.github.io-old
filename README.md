# for routes in portfolio
layout: default
permalink: /readme
title: readme
---
My attempt to make a generic portfolio which uses liquid templating language(jekyll), sass, CoffeeScript, and python for getting data.

(i need a better design but i am not a designer so do not criticizes that too harshly)

<!-- One of my main goals is to make everything usable for another user.
(this is going to be a issue opened to be worked on)
Starting in data folder githubcontent.py should be changed to the person's username
- need to seperate username from get request (and check for auth tokens exits)
- might just get more info just cause and make filter to just make yml what is wanted -->
<!-- By changing a few links it can be done.. (i might need to test it, but in theory it should work... (might need to make a separate readme on what to change to make it for another user)) -->

Anyway to see what I am currently doing to this site check github issues for this repo. [Check it Here!](https://github.com/josuerojasrojas/josuerojasrojas.github.io/issues)

<!-- ## TODO (list for myself) EVERYTHING MOVED TO ISSUES ON GITHUB
