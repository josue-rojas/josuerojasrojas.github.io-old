## TODO (list for myself)
- update this readme (forever)
- continue design for default page
- navBar
  - __make icons for navbar__ (currently working on might take a while since this has to be original)
    - hover and active should be different
    - should also be updated according to data(but that is later)
  - make navbar responsive
    - should hide when it is mobile and have a button to make it appear
    - from tablet and higher it should look regular
- footer
  - contact link
  - about me link?
  - should have readme link on what i am currently working on
- 404
  - should be better styled
- make script to scrape github pages to get content (also currently working on this)
  - ~~use github api just to make things easier~~ done
  - organize data into json object and write it out
  - might move script to data folder to easily write files in right place
