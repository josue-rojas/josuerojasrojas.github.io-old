## TODO (list for myself)
- update this readme (forever)
- continue design for default page
- navBar
  - __make icons for navbar__ (currently working on)
    - hover and active should be different
    - should also be updated according to _data(but that is later)
  - make navbar responsive
    - should hide when it is mobile and have a button to make it appear
    - from tablet and higher it should look regular
- make script to scrape github pages to get content
  - this will make json file to be store in _data

### Resource i used (websites and stuff)
(there might have been more but sometimes i do not keep track of everything)
- [Jekyll Structures](https://jekyllrb.com/docs/structure/)
- [Tutorial for basic start](http://jmcglone.com/guides/github-pages/)

__(!idea maybe have a script to log all websites....)__
